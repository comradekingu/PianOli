         it seems that for some reason it tries to populate the default values
         prior to us dynamically calling setDefaultValues(), meaning that it
         always gets set to null (no selected melodies). By hard coding it, we
         can reference it in the root_preferences XML file and thus it will correctly
         be read the first time the system tries to set the default preferences. -->
